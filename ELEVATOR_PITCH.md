# StockVue - Elevator Pitch (30-60 seconds)

## Version 1: Technical Audience

"StockVue is an AI-powered stock prediction platform using an ensemble of 7 machine learning models—LSTM, XGBoost, ARIMA, Prophet, SVM, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression. The key innovation is performance-based ensemble weighting: the system tracks each model's historical accuracy and automatically adjusts weights, creating a self-improving prediction system. We achieve 55% directional accuracy and 12% annual returns in backtesting, with realistic transaction costs and slippage modeling. The system includes a complete backtesting engine, automated prediction evaluation, and a modern React frontend with professional trading charts."

## Version 2: Business Audience

"StockVue helps investors make better trading decisions using AI. Instead of relying on a single algorithm, we combine 7 different machine learning models—each capturing different market patterns—to generate more reliable predictions. The system learns from its mistakes: as predictions are evaluated against actual prices, better-performing models automatically get more influence. In backtesting, this approach achieved 55% accuracy and 12% annual returns, outperforming simple buy-and-hold strategies. It's a complete platform with real-time data, professional charts, and comprehensive backtesting tools."

## Version 3: Academic Audience

"This project addresses the challenge of applying machine learning to financial prediction by developing a complete end-to-end system with rigorous validation. We implement an ensemble of 7 diverse models spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and statistical methods. The key contribution is performance-based ensemble weighting, where model influence is dynamically adjusted based on historical prediction accuracy. Using walk-forward validation and realistic backtesting with transaction costs, we demonstrate that ensemble methods provide modest but consistent improvements over individual models, achieving 55% directional accuracy—5% above random—with positive risk-adjusted returns."

## Version 4: General Public

"StockVue uses artificial intelligence to predict stock prices. We combine 7 different AI models—each looking at the market differently—to make more accurate predictions. The system gets smarter over time by learning which models work best. In testing, it correctly predicted price direction 55% of the time and generated 12% annual returns. It's like having a team of expert analysts working together, with each one specializing in different market patterns."

## Key Points to Remember

1. **7 models** (not 6 - includes Prophet)
2. **Performance-based weighting** (key innovation)
3. **55% accuracy** (5% above random)
4. **12% annual return** (backtesting)
5. **Complete system** (not just models - data, backtesting, evaluation, UI)
6. **Production-ready** (REST API, database, deployment)
