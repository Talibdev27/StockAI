- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Include smooth animations and transitions
- Use Lucide React icons or similar for UI elements
- Professional typography (Inter, Poppins, or similar)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Build as React functional components with hooks
- Use dummy/placeholder data for now (we'll connect to backend API later)
- Structure code to easily integrate with REST API endpoints:
